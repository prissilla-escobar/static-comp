## Context
I was given a comp to recreate and was not able to take any liberties with the layout. I was able to choose my text font, images, icons, color and theme. I worked on this comp for 6 hours.

## Learning Goals
- Explore both HTML and CSS to further grasp understanding
- Follow comp exactly which requires an eye for detail

## Wins + Challenges
- We were asked to complete this comp using only HTML and CSS. A challenge for me was learning everything that I can do in HTML that I normally do via JavaScript. Since the preferred method is to still use JavaScript, I know I will continue to do that but it was great learning more about HTML.

## Future Features
- Adition of animations
- Use webpack and change CSS to SASS
- Different colors depending on which Hogwarts House the user is apart of

## Resources
- Josh Comeau's custom [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) is being used to ensure that the app is more clean and will lead to a better user experience.
